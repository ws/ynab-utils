# YNAB API Feature Requests

- endpoint to get transactions by flag color
- filter transaction endpoint by memo text server-side
- ability to fetch/update subtransactions by id (ideally using the existing transaction endpoint)
- endpoint to update accounts (specifically account names)
- let me filter the category endpoint by status (eg give me a way to exclude deleted/hidden categories)
- add a description of DEBT to the goal_type enum docs
