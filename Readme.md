# You Probably Shouldn't Use This

I'm open sourcing this just in case some other pour soul also happens to both have this problem and be a JS developer. If you don't fall into both of these categories, this code is probably not going to be very useful for you. There will never be a GUI, proper error handling, additional features, other currencies, etc.
